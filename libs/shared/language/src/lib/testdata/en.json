The \"Plot System\" is the easiest and fastest way to apply as an official Builder. If you are accepted into the Build Team as a Builder, you can build whatever you want on our open world \"Terra Server\"."

Since building at off-angles is quite different from classic Minecraft building, we also have developed a large variety of tools to make it easier to get started. Furthermore, to overcome the Minecraft height limitation we use clever server side modifications like \"Cubic Chunks\"."
