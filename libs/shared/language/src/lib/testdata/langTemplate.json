Das „Plot-System“ ist der einfachste und schnellste Weg, dich als offizielle*r Builder*in zu bewerben.

Da das Bauen in schrägen Winkeln ganz anders als das klassische Bauen im „normalen” Minecraft ist, haben wir einige nützliche Hilfsmittel entwickelt, um das Bauen so einfach wie möglich zu machen."

The challenging recruitment process for our Builders is unattractive for trolls and scammers and keeps the project free of discrimination, spam, griefing and fraud. It also guarantees a minimum level of building skill. The supposed barriers in our linguistic landscape are rarely a problem. Instead, a very friendly community has developed, which results in many new friendships, side projects as well as meetups of the members. "

They make sure our builders, as well as visitors, have a smooth and uncomplicated experience. Furthermore, they also do PR work and raise attention to our project all over the world. Below is a breakdown of the different sub-teams of our build team management: Managers: They manage the project. Each Manager is responsible for his/her own sub-team. They take care of basic decisions and hiring new staff members. Helpers: They support the Managers in their tasks and take care of their own areas of competence (e.g. event planning and moderation). Reviewers: They are responsible for reviewing applications and submitted plots. Developers: They take care of all technical aspects of our project. For more information, see chapter “The Technology”. Public Relations: They represent Alps BTE in public and take care of our social media. Furthermore, they translate texts into several languages, conduct interviews and handle press inquiries. Architects: They take care of creating new plots to build on. They also support the helpers in event preparation."

Once you have created your first plot by jumping into the portal at the spawn, you will arrive at a small floating island with a building outline. The links in the chat will provide you with appropriate references to the building and you can immediately start rebuilding it in Minecraft. If you need help, check out our YouTube channel \"Alps BTE\". There you will find many helpful tips in our \"Builders Guide\" videos. As soon as the building is finished, you hand it in and can immediately start with the next one. The finished buildings will be evaluated by our reviewers and if something doesn't fit, you'll get feedback and the opportunity to revise it. Once two plots have been accepted, you can apply to become an official builder."

It acts as the main server where verified builders can build in any region within Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

The location of the events changes constantly between Austria and Switzerland, mostly building more famous locations like Hallstatt or parts of Lucerne. These events are usually held monthly and have become a fixture in our community. Collabs are basically the same as events, only in cooperation with other regional build teams. Therefore, collabs can take place outside our borders and last longer than 48 hours."
